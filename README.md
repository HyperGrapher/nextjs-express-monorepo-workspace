### Yarn Workspace with Next.js, tRPC, Next-Auth, Tailwind, Prisma, Express

- run <code>yarn</code> on root level to install packages
- run <code>yarn start</code> on root level to start both server and client


### Notes:
- Client <code>"postinstall": "prisma generate"</code> , is not working with yarn workspace so it's removed. Run it manually after clean install
